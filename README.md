### Art Piece 1

I chose “Colour Brain” by Rachel Ku-Paris. It was featured in a collection by Saatchi Art. I was drawn to it for its vibrant colors and take on expanding the perception of what personal growth means. Her description of the piece is “Everyone’s getting older, only a few of us are growing.” I think it’s interesting to think about how we use our limited time and if it actually leads to growth and fulfillment. In the image, the brain takes over the entire head and neck on a shadowed, ambiguous human figure.  As a piece on paper, there is no interactive quality to this piece but I would imagine it would inspire thought and reflection for viewers.

### Art Piece 2

I chose the piece “Columbus the Hero?” by Movers and Shakers, a coalition that “executes direct action and advocacy campaigns for marginalized communities using virtual reality, augmented reality, and the creative art,” according to its website. This piece is shown in the Twitter video by Glenn Cantave, Founder and CEO of Movers and Shakers. It is an app-based installation, intended to become a book that will be an interactive anthology of images, animations, and poetry. The tablet-based app shown in this iteration of the piece displayed at Afrotectopia at ITP at NYU Tisch. The viewer directly interacts with the piece, using the tablet to warp the more traditional images and narratives of Columbus as a hero. I was drawn to this piece because I’m very interested in social justice and how art can be used to create social and political change. The ways we tell history (often in a white, patriarchal lens) reinforce systems of white supremacy and marginalization. This piece reimagines the history of Columbus to show the truth of the mass genocide, slave trade, and colonization he led. While this video only shows a small portion of what is to come in the book, I would be very interested in following it and seeing how the artists link Columbus’s history to the role of white supremacy and marginalization in the Trump-era present.
